# Business Intelligenge Dashboard for TAIFA Mobile
## I. Data
### I.1 Introduction
The dataset used for this study was gathered from Nairobi-based TAIFA Mobile, a mobile services provider with expertise in voice, SMS, USSD codes, and short codes. Metrics on financial transactions, service consumption, customer interaction, and operational efficiency are all included in the data. To facilitate data-driven decision-making, a customized BI dashboard will be developed using all of this data as the support. (The data can be found in the dataset)

The overall dashboard for the cashflow is: ![cashflow analysis](https://github.com/RodrigueIR/Taifa-Mobile-BI-Analysis/assets/117353579/f46b094e-9b82-49d2-9ee1-ebc5abc00f78)
Important visuals consist of:
* Line graphs:
  - Showing the overall revenue as a function of time.
  - Monitoring monthly earnings margins.
* Bar charts:
  - Revenue breakdown by kind of service.
  - Total messages sent for each type of service displayed.
* Pie charts:
  - Showing message open rates broken down by kind of service.
  - displaying the breakdown of costs by services.
## V. Insights
* Business Situation:
  - Over the past year, Taifa Mobile's revenue has shown a favorable trend, showing consistent development.
  - Although service deployment timeframes have been streamlined, operational inefficiencies occasionally cause delays.
* The clientele:
  - Certain consumer categories show higher rates of engagement, indicating that more focused marketing initiatives might improve engagement.
  - Certain geographic locations have high usage of USSD interactions, suggesting possible areas for service providing development.
* Finances:
  - Short codes and phone services have less profit margins than USSD codes and bulk messaging, which are the two most profitable services.
  - Although there are chances to cut expenses in less profitable service sectors, overall financial performance is solid.
* Suppliers:
  - Costs associated with suppliers are concentrated in particular regions, indicating areas where cost optimization might be achieved by improving supplier management and negotiation.
## VI. My recommendations
TAIFA Mobile may improve client engagement, financial performance, operational efficiency, and overall competitiveness in the ever-evolving mobile services industry by implementing the below ideas.
- Improve Data Integration in Real-Time: Use cutting-edge ETL procedures to make sure data is updated instantly and offers the most recent insights.
- Optimize Less Profitable Services: Analyze less profitable services in-depth to find inefficiencies and fix them, maybe reorganizing or ending underwhelming offerings.
- Strategies for Targeted Marketing: To increase engagement and revenue, leverage customer engagement data insights to create focused marketing campaigns that target high-engagement categories.
- Management of Suppliers: Examine and bargain supplier contracts to maximize savings, paying particular attention to the areas where expenses are greatest.
- Training and sustained improvement: Update the BI dashboard often in response to user comments and evolving business requirements. Give users continual training so they can take full use of the BI dashboard's features and make well-informed decisions.
